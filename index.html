            <h2 style="color: #dc9555">Who Was Nikola Tesla?</h2>

            <p>
              Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the
              alternating-current (AC) electric system,which is the predominant
              electrical system used across the world today. He also created the
              "Tesla coil," which is still used in radio technology. Nikola
              Tesla was born in 1856 in what is now Croatia to Serbian parents
              Milutin and Djuka Tesla. His father was a priest, an intellectual
              who prodded his son to develop unusual mental discipline. His
              mother was an inventor of many time-saving devices used for
              domestic tasks. Despite his early success at school and obvious
              interest in experimenting with mechanical devices, Tesla’s father
              was determined that young Nikola become a minister. Only after
              Tesla sank into an acute physical decline did his father relent
              and allow him to continue his scientific education at Graz
              Polytechnic Institute in Austria.

              After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the
              <br />
              Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the
              <br />
              Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of
              Prague
              <br />
              during the 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he
              worked
              <br />
              at the Central Telephone Exchange. It was while in Budapest that
              the
              <br />
              idea for the induction motor first came to Tesla, but after
              several
              <br />
              years of trying to gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla
              <br />
              decided to leave Europe for America.

            <p>
              In 1885, Tesla received funding for the Tesla Electric Light
              Company
              <br />
              and was tasked by his investors to develop improved arc lighting.
              <br />
              After successfully doing so, however, Tesla was forced out of the
              <br />
              venture and for a time had to work as a manual laborer in order to
              <br />
              survive. His luck would change two years later when he received
              <br />
              funding for his new Tesla Electric Company.

          <p></p>
          <p>
            Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed
            ideas for a number of important inventions — most of which were
            officially patented by other inventors — including dynamos
            (electrical generators similar to batteries) and the induction
            motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery of radar technology,
            X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating magnetic field —
            the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known for his
            contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil.

                <h4>AC Electrical System</h4>
                Tesla designed the alternating-current (AC) electrical system,
                which would quickly become the preeminent power system of the
                20th century and has remained the worldwide standard ever since.
                In 1887, Tesla found funding for his new Tesla Electric Company,
                and by the end of the year, he had successfully filed several
                patents for AC-based inventions.
                <br />
                <br />
                Tesla's AC system soon caught the attention of American engineer
                and businessman George Westinghouse, who was seeking a solution
                to supplying the nation with long-distance power. Convinced that
                Tesla's inventions would help him achieve this, in 1888 he
                purchased his patents for $60,000 in cash and stock in the
                Westinghouse Corporation.
                <br /><br />
                As interest in an AC system grew, Tesla and Westinghouse were
                put in direct competition with Thomas Edison, who was intent on
                selling his direct-current (DC) system to the nation. A negative
                press campaign was soon waged by Edison, in an attempt to
                undermine interest in AC power.

                <h4>Hydroelectric Power Plant</h4>
                In 1895, Tesla designed what was among the first AC
                hydroelectric power plants in the United States, at Niagara
                Falls. The following year, it was used to power the city of
                Buffalo, New York — a feat that was highly publicized throughout
                the world and helped further AC electricity’s path to becoming
                the world’s power system.

                <h4>Tesla Coil</h4>
                In the late 19th century, Tesla patented the Tesla coil, which
                laid the foundation for wireless technologies and is still used
                in radio technology today. The heart of an electrical circuit,
                the Tesla coil is an inductor used in many early radio
                transmission antennas.
              </li>
              <li class="fourthAchiev">
                <h4>Free Energy</h4>
                Having become obsessed with the wireless transmission of energy,
                around 1900 Tesla set to work on his boldest project yet: to
                build a global, wireless communication system — to be
                transmitted through a large electrical tower — for sharing
                information and providing free energy throughout the world.
                <br /><br />
                With funding from a group of investors that included financial
                giant J. P. Morgan, in 1901 Tesla began work on the free energy
                project in earnest, designing and building a lab with a power
                plant and a massive transmission tower on a site on Long Island,
                New York, that became known as Wardenclyffe.
